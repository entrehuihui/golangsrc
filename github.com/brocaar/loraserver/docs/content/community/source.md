# LoRa Server source

Source-code can be found at [https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver).

## Building

### With Docker

The easiest way to get started is by using the provided 
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) environment. To start a bash
shell within the docker-compose environment, execute the following command from
the root of this project:

{{<highlight bash>}}
docker-compose run --rm loraserver bash
{{< /highlight >}}

### Without Docker

It is possible to build LoRa Server without Docker. However this requires
to install a couple of dependencies (depending your platform, there might be
pre-compiled packages available):

#### Go

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed (1.10+) and that the LoRa
App Server repository has been cloned into 
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/brocaar/loraserver`.

#### Go protocol buffer support

Install the C++ implementation of protocol buffers and Go support by following
the GO support for Protocol Buffers [installation instructions](https://github.com/golang/protobuf).

### Example commands

A few example commands that you can run:

{{<highlight bash>}}
# install development requirements
make dev-requirements

# install requirements
make requirements

# run the tests
make test

# compile
make build

# compile snapshot builds for supported architectures
make snapshot
{{< /highlight >}}
